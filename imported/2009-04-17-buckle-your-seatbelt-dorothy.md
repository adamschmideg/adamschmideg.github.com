I tested my tagline on some friends. They didn't get it. So I
added, "Buckle your seatbelt, Dorothy". I tested it with a friend,
an American this time. He said, everybody's supposed to understand
it, at least in the States. So I removed the Dorothy part. It's
here, you know, just in case you'd need it.
