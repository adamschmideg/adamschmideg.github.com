In this economic situation, everyone is interested in savings.  I
am exploring here how you can save a few letters when typing.  A
simple method exploited by shorthand and speedwriting systems is to
find the most frequent blocks of letters (n-grams) and use an
abbreviation instead.  The natural consumer's question is, how can
you save most?  
**Bigrams or trigrams?** Suppose, the most frequent bigram (block
of two consecutive letters) is *th* in English.  We could type *1*
for it, so "the royal path" would be spelled "1e royal pa1". 
Suppose furthermore, the most frequent trigram (block of three) is
*ath* in English, so using *2* as an abbreviation would give us the
spelling "m2 is the p2" for  "math is the path".  As you can see,
the longer block is abbreviated, the more letters are saved.  But
longer blocks occur less frequently.  How could you save more, with
bigrams or trigrams?
