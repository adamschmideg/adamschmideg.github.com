A key element of Autofocus is to pick a task from a list
subconsiously, intuitively.  Or how Mark puts it, choose the task
that stands out.  There are pages in my system that keep remaining
active,  I have difficulty to choose what stands out, but I'm also
reluctant to dismiss the whole page.  Here is how I managed to
(subconsciously) work around this.  I scan the list, read each
task, maybe pick one that doesn't feel right.  Then I go out for
something else, make a tea, make a pee, whatever.  And I notice my
mind is busy with an item on the list, not the one I chose, but
another one.  That's my intuitive choice.
