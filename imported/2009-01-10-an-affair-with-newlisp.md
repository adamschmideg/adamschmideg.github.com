My old site used a wiki/CMS created with
[newLISP](http://www.newlisp.org "an easy and smooth variant of Lisp"). 
My experience with it was that it worked just the way my brain
works, it felt so simple and natural. It also has a great and
responsive community.  
Then I changed host and it was difficult to port my old site, due
to the absence of ssh/scp access.  
Thank you, Lutz and you folks, I enjoyed the time spent with you. 
Keep up the good work!  I might return one day.
