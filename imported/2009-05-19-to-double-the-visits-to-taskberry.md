I set a few goals for the next month. One of them is to double the
number of visits to our [TaskBerry](http://www.taskberry.com) site.
I'm not telling the figures, but I'll post about it in a month.
Google analytics distinguishes three sources of visits,
-   direct - you enter the url into the browser
-   search - you're looking for something, and you click on my site
    in the search results

-   referral - you're browsing another site, then click on a link
    to my site

Each of them requires a different approach. To increase direct
visits, I'll need to tell my friend about the goodies they'll find
on my site. To get more visits from search results, I'll have to
provide great content. To have more links to TaskBerry..., I don't
know. It probably takes great content and letting people know about
it. There must be two thresholds on the internet
-   to click or not to click
-   to link or not to link

And you have to be clicked first in order to be linked to.
