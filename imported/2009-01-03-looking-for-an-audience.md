It was easier with the dating site where only members could read my
posts.  I was blogging for women I found attractive.  My posts were
spontaneous, sometimes wild and offensive; I seized every
opportunity to make fun of the very nice and PC ladies who were
looking for gentlemen.  Because I prefer women who don't blush upon
hearing a fuck or two.  Well, it took me some time to become as
spontaneous as I wanted to be.  
This is a different situation now.  I don't want to date -- I won't
respond to posts without a photo.  And English is not my first
language.  It's my second, so it's not that far away.  And I don't
know anything about my audience.
