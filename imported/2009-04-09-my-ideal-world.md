Where would I be happiest? In my ideal world, of course. Everybody
has one and each world is different. In my world, I have the most
beautiful women and houses and cars and whatever. In your world,
you have all of them. If we take it too seriously, if we can't
admit that we're living in a common, maybe-not-ideal world, it can
make big troubles. But dreaming about it is definitely safe if I'm
not going to act on it. To make it come true, that's another piece
of cake or post of blog.

how does it look like? How does it feel to be there? It's not easy
to answer. Is there murder in the ideal world? Is there money
there? Is the annoying next-door lady there? Is your ex there? To
put it another way, if you can choose whatever you like after
death, what heaven would you make up for yourself?  
You can remove all the dark sides of life, erase murder, poverty,
sadness from your heaven. Then you would die of boredom. No
problem, you say, let's remove boredom, too. Philip K Dick had a
character in the
[*Eye in the sky*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_in_the_Sky_(novel))
who removed everything she didn't like until she found herself in
an empty universe.  
I want murder because I like detective stories, I just don't want
murder to take place where I live. Well, in an ideal world, I would
try it once to experience it, then undo it somehow, because I am a
good and moral person after all.
