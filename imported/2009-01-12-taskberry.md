[My darling](http://www.taskberry.com) is here.  It took me a
couple of months to put it together, but certainly less than 9
months.  Men are just faster.  
My latest slogan for it is "the fun of discipline".  How do you
like it?  Or does it sound like an entertaining kinky site for
managers?  It's definitely not.  It's about managing tasks in a fun
and disciplined way.  Check it out and see for yourself.  
To tell the truth, it's a but rough around the edges.  Some edges
are even nonexistent.
