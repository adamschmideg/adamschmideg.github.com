I hate pretending I am a native english speaker.  I not.  I use
spell-checker.  It makes little red dots to teach me.  Dont care. 
I do.  Try not to.  spellchecker is not my brain.  And my brain is
not spellcheckerboard.  Haha.  Funny foreigner thinks he can master
the language.  He just makes fun of herself.  Pronuns intended. 
Pun intended.  
Difficult to pretend I am more stupid than I am.  It gives freedom,
though.  I want more freedom, so I want to fail more.  (Funny
coincidence, *fail* pronounced in Hungarian means
*he is afraid*.)  
I like using italics.  I hate smileys.  People using smileys belong
to a lower caste.  They cannot use proper language, they don't have
a taste for language nuances.  
..... :)  
Huh, I couldn't resist it.  I know it's a bad joke.  I still hate
smileys.  My English is better than that.
