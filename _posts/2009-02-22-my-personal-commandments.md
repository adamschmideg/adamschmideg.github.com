This woman started to take happiness seriously and spent a year to
check old wisdom about it and find her way to it.  One thing she
suggests is that everyone make a list of their
[personal commandments](http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2008/12/new-years-resol.html). 
Here is the beginning of mine
-   Get the most out of it.  Get the most out of yourself.
-   Find a way to enjoy it.
-   Compose your life into a single piece of art.
-   Check regularly if you are on your path.
-   Push your comfort zone.
-   Don't be too hard on yourself.  Don't be too soft on yourself.
