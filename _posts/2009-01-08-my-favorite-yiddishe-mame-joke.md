This yiddishe mame gives a red tie and a blue to tie his son for
his birthday.  He comes down next morning, smiling, wearing the red
tie.  And she says, "so you don't like the blue one"  
Unbeatable.  What could you say?  Let's see some variants.  
1.  
"But, mom..."  
No, it's already wrong.  
2.  
"I can't wear two ties at the same time"  
"*I can't* means *I don't want to*"  
3.  
"There must be one you prefer to the other"  
"So I am right, you don't like the blue one"  
4.  
"Yes, I don't like it"  
"Well, it's really impossible to make you happy"
