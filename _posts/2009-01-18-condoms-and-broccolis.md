JILL: I'm sorry, this is my cart.  
PATRICIA: Did you buy six packs of condom and ten pieces of
broccoli?  
JILL: I didn't pay attention, I just threw in everything I liked.  
PATRICIA: Condoms and broccolis, hmm. Seems perfect for a
vegetarian orgy.  
JILL: Wanna join in?  
PATRICIA: I eat meat.  
JILL: Every day? I mean, every night?  
PATRICIA: If available.  
JILL: So what's in your cart then? Let me see... Ten packs of
condom and six pieces of broccoli. You seem to prefer sex to
eating.  
PATRICIA: I eat meat. And I see one or two of my lovers every day.
Broccoli is rich in vitamin something needed by men.  
JILL: I know, I read probably the same book, "How to organize a
vegie orgy".  
PATRICIA: Never more than two men in the same bed.  
JILL: The question is how many beds you have.  
PATRICIA: One in my bedroom, of course, a sofa in the dining room.
I also have a large dining table. Does it count?  
JILL: It scores only half.  
PATRICIA: Well, Dick is short, so that's a problem... And how about
carpets?  
JILL: At your age?  
PATRICIA: I'm just the organizer. Or voyeur, if you like.  
JILL: I want to peep you peep one day.  
PATRICIA: Your place or my place?  
JILL: It doesn't matter. We got sixteen packs of condom and sixteen
broccolis altogether.
