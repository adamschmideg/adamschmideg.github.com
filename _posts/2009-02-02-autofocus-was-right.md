I've been trying [Autofocus](http://www.markforster.net), Mark
Forster's new task management system.  I was quite anxious for a
while that the system would discard important tasks.  So I kept
looking for tasks on the first page to keep it alive.  Then it
happened, a good half of the tasks got dismissed.  And it was a
relief rather than a source of anxiety.  
It's a nice way to put -- the system did the dirty job, discarding
dead weight.  It's actually my intuitive part that I'm growing to
trust more and more.  
Another challenge came yesterday when I realized at the end of the
day that I hadn't made a step in an important project due within a
few days.  I spent my time on less urgent stuff instead.  That made
me feel guilty, so I explored what I had actually done and what I
hadn't.  Here is the result,
-   I spent much time on a writing project which is due later, but
    it needs a lot of preparation
-   I worked on a less urgent project but it's more important in
    the long run
-   I spent a few hours reading Haskell-related stuff -- it's no
    work, but hey, it was Sunday after all, and too much work and no
    fun makes Jack a dull boy
-   It turned out that the feature I wanted to implement in
    TaskBerry was too complex, a simpler solution would suffice

So I realized, Autofocus was right.  I can trust my intuition.
