(See my previous post about n-back words)  I found only two in
English: *beri**beri***, *hots**hots***. There are some more in
Hungarian: *elők**elők***, *tisz**tisz**olga*, *történe**téne**k*. 
It's addictive, don't read this post before going to bed.  
I really can't stop, I just checked if there are words with an
amazingly repeating block of 5 letters.  None in English, only one
in Hungarian: *tisztesség**esség***.
