Mark Forster suggests a "little and often" approach in task
management.  After just reading small snippets of different stuff
and loading them into my brain, I suggest an addition. 
**Change**little and often.  It doesn't matter how small the change
is, but whatever you do, make a change.  So for example if you have
a task ?Think about cover letter", and you spend only 1 minute
thinking without having any great idea, then just jot down the only
bad idea you had.  It may be one word only.  
This approach has had some advantages for me.  It feels I really
made a step forward, I'm not just playing around.  And looking back
two days later, the bad idea can still be a handle to move on -- it
may even be a base to build on.  
This post is just an example of "change little and often".  I had a
task to blog about my experience with Autofocus.  All I wanted to
do is post a single sentence, it just kept growing.
