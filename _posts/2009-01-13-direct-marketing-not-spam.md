I receive mails recently that claim they are not spam, because they
are not hiding their real address, and one can even unsubscribe
clicking a link. If you have some experience with spams, you know
that clicking such a link has a special meaning to the sender. It
means, "good, this address is valid, so it's worth sending more
mails there".  
Here is what I'm doing with these messages
-   mark them as spam on gmail
-   put their address here for robots, so the senders will get a
    taste of receiving spams and not spams but direct marketing mails

And here is the list,
-   Management Kiadó: managementkiado.kft@upcmail.hu
-   Wellness
    Hotels: wellnesshotels09@gmail.com wellnesshotels@gmail.com
-   Kincsem Wellness Hotel: info@kincsemhotel.hu
