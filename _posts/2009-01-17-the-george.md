MARY: You may not know that I broke up with George since we last
met.

BOB: So I have more chance now...

MARY: More. Enough to invite me for a whisky. Maybe even for a
dinner.

BOB: And what are the chances of having sex after that whisky? Or
after the dinner?

MARY: I don't want to disappoint you...

BOB: OK, I'm waiting till you'll have broken up with Peter, then
with Tom who calls you *Bunny*, then maybe with another George...

MARY: Stop it. And stop fidgeting with my phone.

BOB: Just a sec. Who is this Bergyle? That's a new guy.

MARY: Ann Bergyle?

BOB: A woman? Let me delete it.

MARY: Stop it, bastard. You're ruining your last chance to invite
me for dinner.

BOB: Before having sex?

MARY: Instead of having sex.

BOB: Got it. So Missus Ann Bergyle is gone.

MARY: You really deleted it?

BOB: It was just a woman. Not a candidate to be your partner for
the rest of your life.

MARY: Would you please go further down the list and if you find
your name, delete it, too.

(phone rings)

BOB: It's George. Is it the George?
