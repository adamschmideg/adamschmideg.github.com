I practised Aikido, my master told us, Let your opponent hit where
he wants to, then let him fall where he wants to. I would apply the
same Aikido strategy with spammers. They send out tons of mails in
the hope that one out of a thousand will click on a link. Let's
make them happy, let everyone click on the links. Plugins could be
added to mail clients that processes each spam and clicks every
single link in it. Spammers would get many times more clicks, they
would need a larger infrastructure to cope with it, and a click
wouldn't mean an intention to buy anymore.
