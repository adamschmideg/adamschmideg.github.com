I found a similar minded post about
[the most common internet personality](http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/02/26/internet-personality-types/). 
They concluded the top personality type by the Myers-Briggs
indicator is ENTP, followed by half that many ISTP's.  This was a
result of googling for the types.  What I would do is
-   pick words and phrases typical for each type
-   google for these phrases
-   compare the results
